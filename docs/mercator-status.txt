 - universe.advanceInTime()

PERFORMANCE
 - do not call update bounding box for every frame

ISSUES
- form selecting an item does not show info in the lower pane
- renderer statistics missing
- unierse statistics never showing up
- Q dose not end the application
- cluster bounding box not working


TASKS
	DONE
		- allow selection of objects
		- add screenshot key
		- check font issue and answer ticket
		- introduce logger
		- introduce junit 5

	TODO
		- Game
			- who has the money pie chart
			- number of x per duration (transactions, buy, produce, ...)
			- rotate trader to face translation direction
			- rotate and shift goods on traders
			- implement a communication bus to reduce dependencies
			- water should cover all empty space
			- How to manage the edge of the game area?
		- Audio
			- document audio engine
			- try flanger
			- try ring modulator
			- try equalizer
		- Graphics
			- introduce text capability in 3D
				use pbr renderer
			- test emissive material
				emissive bloom
				you can render a scene with emissive only to a FBO and blur it
			- deferred rendering
				https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/blob/master/tests/gdx-tests/src/com/badlogic/gdx/tests/g3d/MultipleRenderTargetTest.java
			- post processing using depth of field shader
			- investigate depth of field
			- investigate light bloom
			

gdx-are
Openal based Audio Render Engine for libgdx supporting procedurally generated audio.
Openal audio effect including Doppler effect, hall, bass boosting and filtering are supported.
Openal listener position in space and velocity attribute are supported.
All audio is streamed in mono positioned in space and have velocity attributes.
Supports one synthesizer per audio stream.
A synthesizer supports any number of Generators and LFOs. keep in mind that number of generators and LFOs has an impact on performance.
Generators implement the Generator interface, LFOs implement the Lfo interface.
Every audio stream owns a thread that is responsible to render audio when a buffer is ready.
Supports maximum number of device context mono audio streams.
Audio streams are assigned to entities whenever they are within hearing distance.

Automatic effects
openal will adapt audio volume and balance (3D sound) taking into account lister and source position in space.
openal will adapt audio frequency (Doppler) taking into account lister and source velocity.
gdx-are will adapt audio frequency taking into account listener and source position in space.
                - bass is reduced for far sounds
                - treble is boosted for far sounds

Entities have control over the stream to notify
                - spoolup of stream, notifying the start
                - spool-down of stream, notifying the end
                - volume
