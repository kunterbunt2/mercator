A computer game implementation of a ***closed economical simulation***.<br>
The current world is generated procedurally and includes %d cities, %d factories, %d traders and %d sims.<br>   
The amount of wealth in the system, including products and money is constant at all times.<br>
Factories pay wages to sims to produce goods that are sold on a free market.<br>
Some sims are traders that buy products in one city and sell them with profit in another city.<br>   
All sims have needs that they need to fulfill else they die.<br>
All sims have cravings that they need to fulfill to keep their satisfaction level up.<br>  
All sounds are generated by a openal based audio render engine for libgdx supporting procedurally generated audio using **HRTF**.<br>

Work in progress...<br>   
Developed using libgdx and gdx-gltf open source frameworks.<br>
